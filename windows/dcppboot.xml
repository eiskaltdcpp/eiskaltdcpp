	LocalMode runs EiskaltDC++ in local mode, where all defaults are relative to the ConfigPath set below.
	This is useful when running EiskaltDC++ off a USB stick or if you want to keep all in a single folder.
	The default is to run in LocalMode, but upon the user's choice the installer can install a
	dcppboot.xml file that overrides the default.
	When LocalMode is disabled, ConfigPath is ignored.
	Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

	ConfigPath specifies where settings, queue and other runtime data should be saved.
