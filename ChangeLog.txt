* Updated embedded mongoose library to version 5.6.
* Updated embedded jsoncpp library to current state in SVN trunk.
* Added cmake option LOCAL_JSONCPP. Now it is possible to build program with
  system version of library jsoncpp. But have in mind, if this library do not

*** eiskaltdcpp-cli ***

--- 2.2.8 2013-06-23 ---
*** common changes ***
* Fix build with Boost >= 1.50. Dropped support for Boost < 1.39.
* Added support of Lua 5.1.x (used by default) and Lua 5.2.x.
* The local copy of miniupnpc is updated to version 1.7. Build with old
  miniupnpc versions (1.5.x and 1.6.x) is still supported.
* Fix connection problem when hub domain name has IPv6 address. While we do not
  have IPv6 support yet, hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC was causing the connection
  problem. [Thanks to Jan Vidar Krey]
* Changed logic of search intervals: now minimum search interval can be equal
  to zero. [Thanks to Dmitry Arkhipov]
* Fixed file names for cache of public hub lists: now these files are saved and
  loaded properly.
* Now mutexes from C++11 standard are used in *nix systems. While MinGW does
  not support this feature, mutexes from Boost are used in MS Windows.
  Added cmake option DO_NOT_USE_MUTEX (default: OFF), which switches on the
  old algorithm: Haiku and WINE do not support mutexes yet, so this option
  is necessary for them. Also this option is used for build in Mac OS X.
* Added option for keeping unfinished downloads of file-lists in queue between
  program restart. (Disabled by default, because it is not very useful: user
  may leave hub or change CID and such file-list will be in download queue
  until you manually delete it.)
* Added option for choosing MIME handler (i.e. kfmclient, gnome-open). Use
  MimeHandler field in DCPlusPlus.xml to set it manually.
* Fixed buffer overflow error on exit. Problem was caused by attempt to read
  data from closed UDP socket.

*** eiskaltdcpp-gtk ***
* Fixed opening of public hub lists from cache.
* Added progress bar into search widget.
* Added menu item "Match all listings".
* Fixed a number of warnings about using deprecated functions in latest
  versions of Gtk+ and GLib libraries.
* In the file list widget parsing of file lists was detached into separate
  thread, which solved the problem with a short GUI frieze during opening of
  large file lists.
* Added menu items for opening partial file lists.
* Added possibility of configuring the file exceptions in settings dialog.
  (In previous versions of program it was possible to configure this by
  manually editing of DCPlusPlus.xml.)
* Improved look and fill of settings dialog.
* Added option to show user list on the left side of hub widget.
* Improved transfers widget: now all information is in separate columns, so
  some of them can be hided if necessary.

  fixed segmentation fault during stopping of mongoose when it was not started.
* Additional fixes in jsoncpp:
  - all source files were combined into three files (.cpp and .h)
  - added conversion from string to int/uint/int64/uint64/float/double
* Now eiskaltdcpp-daemon is ready for daily use via JSON-RPC.
* XML-RPC is not recommended, but it is still supported.
*** eiskaltdcpp-cli ***
* Added new JSON-RPC methods: hash.pause, hash.status, hub.getuserinfo,
  hub.getusers, hub.listfulldesc, methods.list, queue.getsources,
  queue.matchlists.
* Now eiskaltdcpp-cli-jsonrpc is ready for daily use.
* eiskaltdcpp-cli-xmlrpc is not supported.

* Added chat command and toggle button for disabling chat in hub widget.
* Added some options in favorite hub settings dialog: disable chat and
  external IP.
* Changed algorithm of actions for left click on system tray icon. The same

* Thanks to Stefano Simoncelli the Italian translation is now available.
* Fixed rewriting external IP when DHT is used.
* Added support for reading and writing full TTH tree in the file attribute.

  https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/eiskaltdcpp/
*** eiskaltdcpp-qt ***
* Refactoring of source code. Regressions are possible.
* Now GCC >= 4.5.0 is required for build. (Features from C++11 are used)

  of the program is used now.
* A lot of new methods are now available using QtScript. See:
  http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting
  http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting_QtScript_Example_Scripts
  http://code.google.com/p/eiskaltdc/wiki/Scripting_Working_With_QtScript

  download-directory-history-items-number, memorize-tth-search-phrases
* Added buttons for navigation in the file list widget: back, forward, up.
* Shared memory is freed when program in falling down by the signal SIGSEGV.
  Without this program is run only the second time. Actual for unix-like
  systems only, in MS Windows bug was absent.
* Fixed a simultaneous operation of the program for multiple users.
  The environment variable LOGNAME is used to identify the current user
  in unix-like systems and GetUserNameA is used in MS Windows.

  This option is disabled in the settings by default. It is possible to
  completely remove support for DHT during configuration (option -DWITH_DHT
  for cmake). DHT requires white external IPv4 for a work. See also:

* Fixed build in Mac OS X.
*** eiskaltdcpp-qt ***
* Added some options in settings dialog: DHT, DHT_PORT
* Fixed wrong logging of private chats.

  starts searching.
* Added possibility to connect to hubs on encoded URLs, for example:
  dchub://%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B1.%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82.%D1%80%D1%84

  reduces memory consumption and does not create a short GUI frieze. Especially
  noticeable when opening large file lists.
* Fixed definition of user availability status in the favorite users widget.
* Fixed display the progress of over 100% in downloads progress indicator
  in the active transfers widget.
* Changed algorithm to test run only one instance of the program.

*** eiskaltdcpp-gtk ***
* Migrating from Libglade to GtkBuilder. Compatibility with the code base of
  LinuxDC++ and FreeDC++ was partially lost.

  in code now. Support of older versions (only Gtk >= 2.18) is temporarily
  retained by using the insertions in code and additional patches.
* Added some options in settings dialog: DHT, DHT_PORT, DYNDNS_ENABLE,
  DYNDNS_SERVER
* Some improvements in settings dialog.
* Improvement in the search widget: pressing Return key in size entry field
  starts searching.

* Async loading of history from databases was implemented in widget of finished
  transfers.
* Added temporary limitation to the number of items loaded from the databases
  on program startup (only 500 elements from the history of finished transfers).

*** eiskaltdcpp-gtk ***
* Improvements in the search widget.

--- 2.2.0 2011-01-16 ---
*** common changes ***
* Completed the transition to the 0.770 kernel. Version 0.770 is conditional,
  since it's used the patches from more recent revisions. However, full
  synchronization with lastest DC++ kernel is not planned because of some
  of its shortcomings. For example: 1) a deeper connection to libboost;
  2) using of the code, which requires -std=c++0x and gcc >= 4.5.x;
  3) using settings of the graphical window in the kernel config.

  which located are files of file.txt, FILE.txt and/or File.txt, now it will not
  cause problems with the permanent updating of the share and all these files
  will be simultaneously available to other users for downloading. By default
  this option is disabled, because it can cause a violation of compatibility
  with other DC-clients.
  (see discussion: https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxdcpp/bug/311818)
* Note: when upgrading to this version of program, after restarts, it will be
  forced once fully rehashing your files. This is due to the fact that now file
  hashes are stored in case-sensitive form. The way a file-list will be formed
  from these hashes depends on the option described above. By default, the file

  the specification.
